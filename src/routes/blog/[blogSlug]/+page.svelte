				My juice business <a href="https://www.goodnature.com/consulting" class="link"
					>consulting team</a
				> has consulted over 500 juice and smoothie bars in the past ten years, and I can say from
				experience that starting a juice bar usually is a fairly similar process for almost everyone,
				some people just come to us at different stages of the process. I have outlined the most important
				steps of the process below!
			</p>
			<h2 id="know-your-market" class="title text-3xl scroll-mt-28">Know your market</h2>
			<p>
				It's important to understand the local market. Usually, people either live in an area that
				already is familiar with cold pressed juice and the benefits of juicing, or it's brand new
				to their area and it's up to them to introduce their local community to a healthier
				lifestyle.
			</p>
			<p>
				From what we've seen, basically the less competition the better. So if you're the first
				juice bar in your area, that's usually a <em>good</em> thing, not a bad thing. Even in small
				towns across the US, there is enough demand to support at least one juice bar. When people
				come into your store for the first time and try delicious juice or a dazzling smoothie, they
				will become a regular pretty quickly and start to live a healthier life.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are in a market that's already saturated with juice bars, you just have to be
				prepared to offer something unique and spend the time and money on a compelling and
				differentiated brand.
			</p>
			<h2 id="step-1-develop-your-brand-identity" class="title text-3xl scroll-mt-28">
				Step 1: Develop your brand identity
			</h2>
			<p>
				Before you work on recipes, equipment budgets, and interior design, you should work on a
				truly unique and captivating brand. Absolutely <strong>do not</strong> just copy your favorite
				juice bar. Lots of clients that come to us with a struggling juice bar don't really know why
				they sell the products they do, they just copied someone else or paid for a pre-made menu that
				is not unique.
			</p>
			<img
				src="https://images.prismic.io/goodnature/bc08100a-10e0-4390-bdeb-26a36dc930c1_Lovely+lemon+juice+co.PNG?auto=compress,format"
				width="2139"
				height="1202"
				alt="juice"
			/>
			<p>
				You need to find <em>your</em> voice and make sure that speaks through your products to your
				customers. Every product, every label design, every communication should be tied back to your
				brand identity. Branding is hard to get right, but so very important. When we work with a new
				client, we consider this phase the most important, as it sets the direction for everything
				in the following phases.
			</p>
			<h2 id="step-2-create-your-menu" class="title text-3xl scroll-mt-28">
				Step 2: Create your menu
			</h2>
			<p>
				Now that you know your local market and have a unique, captivating brand, it's time to
				develop your menu. Many people think the menu should come first, but that's not true. It's
				ok to have an idea of certain recipes, but you really cannot finalize a menu without
				knowing the brand. Your brand identity will drive your product decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, is your brand meant to be mass market, or are you targeting a specific health
				and wellness niche? If you are targeting a specific niche, you might create some special
				juices or supplements that target that niche. If you are going for more mass market, you
				might stick to approachable recipes with flavors that people are more familiar with.
			</p>
			<p>
				Product names should all be tied back to the brand. For example if your juice bar name is
				"New York City Juice", you could name your juices after famous New York locations. Or if
				your brand is based around yoga, your items could be named after yoga poses and concepts.
			</p>
			<p></p>

		<div class="rich-text text-eerie container lg:max-w-[800px]">
			<h2 id="step-3-know-your-numbers" class="title text-3xl scroll-mt-28">
				Step 3: Know your numbers
			</h2>
			<p>
				You have to know your food costs. You need to calculate how much each specific recipe will
				cost to make so you know what to charge. A common mistake we see is juice bars charging a
				certain price just because other juice bars are charging that price, but they don't even
				know why or know if they are making money! Don't charge $8 for celery juice because you
				see another juice bar charging $8. Charge $8 for celery juice because that gives you a
				healthy profit margin on your $2 food cost. If you don't know your food cost, you can't
				possibly make smart pricing decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of our specialties is creating recipe cost calculators for our client's recipes. They
				simply fill in their up-to-date produce costs, and the calculator will give them the food
				cost per serving, plus a minimum price recommendation. As produce costs change frequently,
				it's important to be able to calculate this on the fly and make sure you are selling
				profitable items.
			</p>
			<h2 id="step-4-find-the-perfect-location" class="title text-3xl scroll-mt-28">
				Step 4: Find the perfect location
			</h2>
			<p>
				Ideally, you start this process around the same time as starting your recipe development.
				It's important to find a location that has the right type of layout for what you're tying
				to accomplish. The products you sell will determine what that means exactly. For example,
				are you offering acai bowls and smoothies? If so, you will need a lot more counter space
				than if you're just doing juice and grab and go items. Are you offering made-to-order
				juices, or making bottled juice? If making made-to-order juice, you will need a lot more
				cooler space for fresh produce in the front of house than if you're making batches of
				bottled juice in the back of house. These decisions and more can only come after you start
				to know your branding, products, and menu mix.
			</p>

				calls with industry experts, exclusive educational content, and more.

		<div class="rich-text text-eerie container lg:max-w-[800px]">
			<p>
				Once you are fairly confident about the business specifics, you can start to look around
				your area for retail locations. For a standard juice and smoothie bar, you might get lucky
				and find a location that used to offer the same products. Ideally, you find a spot that
				has at least been a café or coffee shop so you know it has the right infrastructure. The
				hardest thing to do is take over a retail location that hasn't done any food service, as
				you'll have to do a complete buildout to get up to health code.
			</p>
			<h2 id="step-5-design-your-juice-bar-layout" class="title text-3xl scroll-mt-28">
				Step 5: Design your juice bar layout
			</h2>
			<p>
				Now that you know what your location looks like, you can develop your detailed layout for
				the location. Speaking of equipment, make sure you're using a real juice press and not a
				centrifugal or masticating juicer. A true two stage juicer will give you the highest yield
				and longest shelf life of any <a href="/blog/types-of-juicers" class="link"
					>type of juicer</a
				>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="rich-text text-eerie container lg:max-w-[800px]">
			<h2 id="step-6-get-your-plans-approved" class="title text-3xl scroll-mt-28">
				Step 6: Get your plans approved
			</h2>
			<p>
				It's important to work with the health department early-on in the process and get your
				equipment list and sanitation plan approved. If you wait until right before opening, you
				may get the unfortunate surprise that your plan is missing something required by the
				health department. Some health departments require things like a grease trap even if you
				aren't cooking food. It's best to find this out right away so you can work it into your
				budget and reduce the chance for delays.
			</p>
			<h2 id="step-7-prepare-for-launch" class="title text-3xl scroll-mt-28">
				Step 7: Prepare for launch
			</h2>
			<p>
				Get ready to open by making sure you have all of your standard operating procedures
				planned out. Since a juice bar is a restaurant, we recommend either having a real chef on
				staff, or partnering with one for this phase. An efficient business has everything planned
				out from opening and closing checklists, back of house and front of house log books,
				staffing and payroll strategy, and more. These are things that classically trained chefs
				or hospitality management professionals learn in their schooling.
			</p>
			<p>
				A juice bar is dependent on your local community, so get out there and spread the word.
				Attend local events and set up a juice sampling station if you can. Try working with local
				yoga studios, farmers markets, and consider sponsoring local sporting events. You also
				need to make sure people can find you on social media and google maps.
			</p>
			<p></p>
			<blockquote>
				<strong>Pro tip:</strong> Pay a real professional photographer for product and location photos.
				It makes a real difference for your social media posts, google maps photos, and menu photos.
				There are plenty of services to skip out on when starting a juice bar, but photography is not
				one of them! Look for a local photographer to help, it should only cost a few hundred dollars.
			</blockquote>
			<p></p>
			<h2 id="final-step-host-a-soft-open" class="title text-3xl scroll-mt-28">
				Final Step: Host a soft open
			</h2>
			<p>
				Finally, it's time to open your doors to friends and family for the soft open. A soft open
				is basically your first day running a real business, but is usually not open to the
				general public. People that are invited to a soft open usually understand things may not
				go as smoothly as possible, and their may be hiccups in the service. Maybe there are staff
				training issues, or the POS isn't set up properly. Maybe some of the equipment needs some
				tweaking, or some of the recipes aren't perfect. All of these issues and more are exactly
				the reason to plan a soft open. Often times, restaurants will leave a break of a few days
				between the soft open and the grand opening in order to fix the issues.

						Do you offer consulting for start up at a Farmers market? I am in the very beginning,
						planning stage, and would like to set up at a Farmers Market this year. I have a
						meeting with the market manager next week. I am doing this because I want to test the
						market and my recioes before i build something at home to make juices in. I live an
						hour from the nearest large town, and am thinking i want to do a business model where
						I create juices and other healthy food items in a certified kitchen at my home, and
						then delivery a couple days per week At this time I am not really considering opening
						a juice bar due to the 1 hour drive each way to Lynchburg. I live 5 miles out from a
						very small, very rural town and would consider opening something there if I could find
						a suitable building that didn't need renovation, and then still going with the
						delivery and frozen juice model, with lunch time open hours for local people. I want
						to use the Farmers Market to gain experience. I have been unable to get anyone on the
						phone at the health dept to find out about regulations, so really stumped at this
						first basic step.
